# tree_sway
Simple library to measure tree sway from videos.

requires numpy and ffmpeg

Use the Video_Reader class in video_reader.py to read video from a file into a numpy array

See simple_fft.py for a simple example (and modify and use as is if desired)

See vid_fft.py for a more sophisticated example.

See vid_proc.py for an example based on particle tracking instead of a simple brightness FFT.
